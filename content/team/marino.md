“Wine is a journey with different travel companions and different destinations”, says Marino, who wishes to make this trip unforgettable for all guests.

From his first work experience in his homeland of Sardinia – Italy, Marino Braccu carries with him a true passion for food and wine throughout his travels.

From 2007 to 2014, Marino moves to Australia to start his career as Sommelier of Mille Vini, a reputable enoteca in Sydney, and later on his latest assignment at Rosetta, of famed Chef Neil Perry, in Melbourne.

In summer 2014, the opportunity to work at 8 ½ Otto e Mezzo BOMBANA brings him to Hong Kong, excited to further sharpen his palate with Chef Bombana’s cuisine.

Joining the team as Sommelier and promoted to General Manager in 2016, Marino has carried out a meticulous work of reorganization and development of the wine list, his objectives being the expansion towards Italian indigenous grape varieties, a customer friendly approach, and bringing more unique and exclusive products to the Hong Kong connoisseurs, whether Italian or from the rest of the world.

8 ½ Otto e Mezzo BOMBANA is proud to have Marino leading the team in its daily operations and sharing his wine expertise, complementing perfectly Chef Bombana’s culinary creations and enriching the guests’ dining experience.
